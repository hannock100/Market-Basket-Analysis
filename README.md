# Market-Basket-Analysis
A data mining project using association rule learning to identify frequent item-sets and customer purchase patterns

# ðŸ›’ Market Basket Analysis

This project uses **Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)** to discover relationships between items purchased together in a retail dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Objective
To identify frequent itemsets and association rules that help understand customer purchasing behavior.

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Apriori algorithm
- Association Rule Mining (support, confidence, lift)
- Visualization of frequent itemsets

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- mlxtend
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Install dependencies:
